### ðŸŽ‰ MAJOR MILESTONE: Login Agents Working End-to-End

This release represents a major breakthrough - login agents now work completely from creation to successful automation!

### Added

- **Complete Login Agent Workflow**: Users can now create, record, analyze, and test login agents successfully
- **Screen Recording Integration**: Users record their login process which is analyzed to create automation scripts
- **Automated Login Testing**: Puppeteer-based browser automation that actually tests login credentials
- **Credential Management**: Secure editing and updating of login credentials
- **Status Management**: Comprehensive status tracking (NEEDS_TESTING, BROKEN, READY_FOR_AGENTS, etc.)

### New Features

#### Login Creation & Management
- **3-Step Wizard**: Credentials â†’ Recording â†’ Save workflow
- **Screen Recording**: Users record their login process for analysis
- **Credential Encryption**: All passwords and sensitive data encrypted at rest
- **Status Tracking**: Clear status indicators for each login (Needs Testing, Ready for Agents, etc.)

#### Automated Testing
- **Puppeteer Integration**: Real browser automation for login testing
- **Smart Form Detection**: Automatically finds username, password, and submit fields
- **Success Detection**: Multiple methods to verify successful login
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of bad credentials and login failures

#### User Experience
- **Edit Credentials**: Users can update login credentials when they change
- **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages and recovery paths
- **Loading States**: Proper feedback during async operations
- **Security**: Password fields always empty for security reasons

### New API Endpoints

- `POST /api/logins` â€“ Create login with recording support
- `GET /api/logins` â€“ List user logins with masked credentials
- `PUT /api/logins/[id]` â€“ Update login credentials
- `DELETE /api/logins/[id]` â€“ Delete login
- `GET /api/logins/[id]/status` â€“ Get login status and analysis results
- `POST /api/logins/[id]/test-interactive` â€“ Test login with browser automation
- `GET /api/logins/[id]/credentials` â€“ Get unmasked username for editing
- `POST /api/logins/[id]/check` â€“ Check if login needs reconnection

### Database Schema Changes

- Added `NEEDS_TESTING` status to `LoginStatus` enum
- Added `recordingUrl` field for screen recordings
- Added `analysisStatus` and `analysisResult` fields
- Enhanced error tracking with `errorMessage` and `failureCount`

### Security Enhancements

- **Credential Encryption**: All passwords encrypted using AES-256
- **Masked Responses**: API responses mask sensitive credentials
- **Secure Editing**: Password fields never pre-populated
- **Authentication**: All endpoints require valid session

### Technical Improvements

- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling throughout the workflow
- **Status Management**: Smart status transitions based on test results
- **Browser Automation**: Robust Puppeteer integration with proper cleanup
- **File Management**: Secure handling of uploaded recordings

### Breaking Changes

- Login creation now requires screen recording
- Status workflow changed (NEEDS_TESTING instead of immediate READY_FOR_AGENTS)
- Removed reconnect feature (replaced with edit credentials)

### Migration Notes

- Existing logins will need to be re-tested to update their status
- Users should record new login processes for optimal automation
- Old reconnect functionality has been replaced with edit credentials
